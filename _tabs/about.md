Hi, I'm passionate about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I'm a detail-oriented Statistician and Researcher with 2+ years of experience leveraging Stata, R, SPSS, and Python to derive actionable insights from complex datasets. Possess a B.Sc. in Statistics and expertise in Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint). Proven ability to manage the full data lifecycle—from collection, entering, and cleaning to advanced inferential analysis and visualisation—directly supporting evidence-based decision-making in public health and development research. Eager to apply and expand my skills in statistical modelling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to solve complex problems, contributing to evidence-based decision-making with a data-driven team while progressing on my journey to become a proficient Data Scientist.
