Hi, I'm passionate about Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I'm currently expanding my knowledge in these areas and looking for projects and opportunities to apply the knowledge and skills. I'm skilled in research, data collection, data management, data entry, data analysis, and visualization using applications like Stata, SPSS, R, Python, Canva, Datawrapper, Power BI, NVivo, and Microsoft Office (Excel). My term goal is to use AI, Data Science, and ML applications in advancing solutions that are scalable and contribute to the community.
